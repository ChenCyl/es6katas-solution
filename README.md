[ES6Katas.org](https://es6katas.org/) is a simple website that lists various katas (small tasks) for learning ECMAScript 6 by doing it. Each kata links to [tddbin](https://tddbin.com/) and loads the according source code in there. All you have to do is fix the failing tests. And by doing so you are supposed to use and learn ES6 one small task and feature at a time.
